🚀 Text Generation Explorer with GPT-2

Explore the future of AI text generation in real time!

🌟 Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Text Generation Explorer is an interactive tool for exploring GPT-2, a powerful language model. This project lets you generate creative text and experiment with different generation strategies, all through a simple and intuitive interface.
Whether you're learning about NLP, language models, or AI creativity, this tool gives you hands-on experience with modern text generation techniques.

🔑 Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Token Analysis
Inspect how GPT-2 tokenizes your input text.
See the most probable next words and their likelihoods.
Understand the inner workings of language models step by step.

2️⃣ Token-by-Token Generation
Generate text one token at a time using a greedy approach.
Watch how GPT-2 builds sentences and sequences from your prompt.

3️⃣ Multi-Strategy Text Generation
Greedy: Deterministic, picks the most likely token each step.
Beam Search: Balances quality and creativity by exploring multiple sequences.
Sampling: Introduces randomness for more diverse and unexpected text.

4️⃣ Interactive Web Interface
Powered by Gradio, the interface lets you adjust parameters live.
Compare different strategies and outputs side by side.
Share your experiments instantly with a public link.
Experiment with prompts, strategies, and parameters easily!

🎛️ Adjustable Parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Customize your text generation experience with:
max_new_tokens – How long the generated text can be.
num_return_sequences – How many variations to produce.
num_beams – Quality control in beam search.
repetition_penalty – Discourage repeated words.
temperature – Adjust creativity and randomness.
top_k / top_p – Fine-tune token selection during sampling.
seed – Reproduce the same outputs for experiments.

📌 Why This Project is Cool
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Educational: Understand how GPT-2 predicts the next word.
Interactive: Instantly see the effect of changing parameters.
